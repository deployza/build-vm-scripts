# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

> ## 📖 Read the architecture docs first
> The overall Cloud Build / deploy / Terraform architecture lives in the
> **`build-docs`** repo, cloned as a sibling of this one:
> [`../build-docs/README.md`](../build-docs/README.md) — see especially
> [`../build-docs/build-design.md`](../build-docs/build-design.md) §5–§7 (the
> boot-time app-install flow).
>
> **If that path does not exist, you have not cloned `build-docs` yet — stop and
> clone it first** (it sits next to this repo under `Build/`):
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/deployza/build-app-install.git
> ```
> Without it you are missing the cross-repo context (how this repo fits the
> image / GCS-artifact / boot-launcher flow).

## What this repo is

**Per-app boot-time deploy scripts.** These are the scripts a host runs to
install a Deployza application onto itself — cloned at boot/start by the launcher
**baked into the images** (`vm-startup.sh` on a VM, `docker-startup.sh` in a
container; both live in the image repos, not here).

One script per app **per platform**:

```
build-app-install/
├── vm/<APP_NAME>.sh       # deploy into a native systemd Tomcat on a VM
└── docker/<APP_NAME>.sh   # deploy into the PID-1 Tomcat of a container
```

The launcher clones this repo to `/tmp/deployza/repo`, then runs
`<clone>/<platform>/<APP_NAME>.sh <APP_ENV>`. `APP_NAME` selects the script (its
basename); `APP_ENV` (`development` / `production`) is the sole argument.

Each script: downloads the app's `conf/` folder + WAR from **GCS**
(`gs://deployza-apps/<APP_ENV>/<APP_NAME>/`), reads `install.properties`,
provisions the MySQL DB/user, installs the per-webapp Tomcat context
(`<ctx>.xml` + properties + logback) into `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost`,
and deploys the WAR under the stable name `<ctx>.war` (serving at `/<ctx>`).

Currently one app: **`assess-server`**.

## The deploy contract

- **`install.properties` (in the GCS `conf/` folder) is the single source of
  truth.** The script derives **nothing** on its own — every value (WAR filename,
  `CATALINA_HOME`, context path, app-properties/logback filenames, DB
  name/user/password, MySQL root creds) is read from it. Key list is documented in
  the header comment of each script and in `build-docs/build-design.md` §2.
- Conf files are installed **verbatim** — absolute paths inside `<ctx>.xml` must
  already match `install.catalina.home`.
- The WAR is staged under its real versioned filename but **deployed as
  `<ctx>.war`**, so the context path is stable across versions.
- An empty `install.mysql.root.password` means "authenticate over the
  passwordless local socket" (the baked `mysql`/`tomcat-mysql` image installs
  MySQL with no root password) — the `-p` flag is then omitted.

## vm/ vs. docker/ — deliberately separate, not one script behind a flag

Keep the two as explicit copies. They share the same shape but differ where the
runtimes differ; do **not** merge them behind a platform flag.

| | `vm/<app>.sh` | `docker/<app>.sh` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tomcat identity | `tomcat` **systemd** service, runs as the `tomcat` user | **PID 1** (root); no `tomcat` user exists |
| File ownership | `install -o tomcat -g tomcat`, `chown tomcat:tomcat` | **no** `chown` (would fail "invalid user: tomcat" and, under `set -e`, abort the deploy / kill the container) |
| Deploy style | **hot-deploy** into a live Tomcat: undeploy old context, wait for the exploded dir to vanish, drop new WAR under a temp name then `mv` (watcher never sees a partial WAR) | **plain drop**: Tomcat isn't running yet — remove old, copy new, return; the entrypoint then `exec`s `catalina.sh run` |
| Log target | app logs to files under `/home/tomcat/instance/logs/<app>/` (per its logback) | app logs to **stdout** — `<ctx>.xml` must not point logback at a file dir |

## Conventions

- `#!/bin/bash` + `set -euo pipefail` at the top of every script.
- **The script returns when the deploy is done** — it is a deploy step, not a
  long-running process. On a VM it runs under `vm-startup.service` (`Type=oneshot`,
  goes `active (exited)`); the real server (Tomcat) is a separate unit. In a
  container it returns and the entrypoint execs Tomcat.
- **Idempotent**: clear the staging dir, re-download, undeploy the old context,
  deploy the new one — safe to re-run (a redeploy is "push to GCS, re-run
  startup"). Never append/duplicate.
- **Staging dir** is `/tmp/deployza/<APP_NAME>/` — this app's sibling of the
  clone (`/tmp/deployza/repo`), owned by this script. Same path whether launched
  at boot or run standalone over SSH.
- Read `install.properties` via the `read_prop` / `require_prop` helpers (last
  matching line wins; surrounding quotes stripped). Use `require_prop` for keys
  that must be non-empty; only `install.mysql.root.password` may be empty.
- **No secrets in this repo — ever.** Every sensitive value comes from the GCS
  `conf/install.properties` at deploy time. This repo is safe to keep public.

## When adding a new app

1. Add `vm/<app>.sh` **and** `docker/<app>.sh` (copy `assess-server` as the
   template; keep the vm/docker differences above).
2. Fix `APP_NAME` in each to the new name (it is hardcoded — the script *is* that
   app's installer; the launcher resolves it by filename).
3. Ensure the app's `conf/` (incl. `install.properties`) + WAR are published to
   `gs://deployza-apps/<env>/<app>/`.
4. Launch a host with metadata/env `APP_NAME=<app>` `APP_ENV=<env>`.

## Gotchas

- `APP_NAME` is **fixed** inside each script, not taken from the launcher — the
  script is resolved *by* its filename, so the name is already implied. Only
  `APP_ENV` is a runtime argument, and it is **required** (no default — a missing
  value aborts rather than deploying to the wrong environment).
- Requires `gsutil` and (for the MySQL step) a reachable `mysql` on the host —
  both are present on the baked `tomcat` / `tomcat-mysql` images, so these scripts
  assume the matching image flavor. There is no local test harness in this repo.
- These files are line-ending sensitive (they run under `bash` on Linux) — keep
  them LF, not CRLF.
